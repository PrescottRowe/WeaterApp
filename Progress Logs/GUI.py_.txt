Created a personal logo, found free icons (with artist atrib)
Landing screen now has an automatically adjusting background image, text field, logo, debug button.
Formatted for portrait use. Since the widgets all float dynamically for different screen sizes and resolutions it is set to keep the
portrait aspect ratio. Otherwise the widgets are all squished to close to each other.

Added in functions to pass user input to backend. Need to read Fredsons documentation on how to accept forecast json data. Added anticipated
libraries and functions but are all empty/unused at the moment. 
  -note- all classes are currently in one file might split up the kv files and GUI files later on as the number of screens increases.
