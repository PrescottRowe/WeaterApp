Python-for-android: is a packaging CUI program that takes python and kivy code and packs it into an apk.
Buildozer: is a wrapper program that takes an argument file and based off of the arguments runs the mapped commands through to python-for-
android to help speed up the build process.
  ~To get all of this to work with our code we had to match the kivy version and cython version. The pair i went with was 1.9.1 kivy and 23.1 cython
    The file that contains main must be labled main.py. All kv files must be lowercase and include kivy versioning. The main.py file must contain
    version info matching the regular expression in the spec file. The apk was also packed with the request, openssl, and kivy librarys.
    The android does not like the current dynamic weather icons in the kv file so a default place holder needs to be added instead of leaving it empty durring load.
    There cannot be unicode characters only ascii so when we use the deg symbol for temp it needs to be the ascii one.
