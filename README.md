API's : Google(to get location cordinates based off of zip/city), Darksky(to get forecast data worldwide)
Current idea: Will have a basic daily/weekly forecast and alerts for worldwide use. Will have an auto save feature for offline lookups. 
Future additions: Might add functionality to have saved locations and other forecast types like polution, moon phases, tides, ect.
